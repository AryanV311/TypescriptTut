//? In TypeScript, tuples are a data structure that allows you to store a fixed-size collection of elements of different types. They are similar to arrays, but with a key difference: the types of elements in a tuple are fixed and declared at the time of creation, whereas arrays can hold elements of the same type, and their size can vary.4

type PersonInfo = readonly[string,number,boolean]

const displayPersonInfo =(person:PersonInfo) => {
    const [name, age, hasCourseLicense] = person;

    return `Name:${name}, Age:${age}, Course License:${hasCourseLicense ? "yes":"No"}`
}

const detaile1:PersonInfo = ["typescript",29,true]
console.log(displayPersonInfo(detaile1))

// detaile1.push("challenge")  //! it will create a problem, it will add element in define structure tuple, so thats why we use readonly method to cover this issue, || uncomment to check there is error occur after apply readonly method to the tuple
// console.log(detaile1);
